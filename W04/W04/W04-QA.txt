// Challenges Complete:
1. Challenge 1 - NecklaceApp: The Necklace Problem using vectors and functions
2. Challenge 2 - NecklaceV2: The Necklace Problem using recursive function
3. Challenge 3 - RandomChallenge: Random Generator to find number entered by user
4. Challenge 4 - W04: W04 Challenge, a function to return a number cubed. 
5. Challenge 5 - UserInput.h: Personal Challenge to create User Input validation code

NOTE: The same "UserInput.h" file is used in all the projects/challenges to get user input. That 
was the purpose of that personal challenge. 

// Q&A For W04:

1. Templates
2. Difference between template <typename T> and template <class T>
3. Best way to include .h files in multiple projects, rather than copying and pasting (UserInput.h)
4. UserInput.h: Use of static template functions, unable to use .h file do define functions and .cpp file to implement them. 
5. UserInput.h: Better to use a reference inside function and set the variable inside the function, or to return a value?
5. UserInput.h: Using a class with static funcionts instead of "free functions"
