Week 05 - Q&A

1. Lambda Functions and their uses. I used a recursive one in the project, with the help of an online resource, but I definitely do not understand how it works (especially the use of &&).
2. Inline Functions. What are they and what are they used for?
3. What is the final project for the course? Is it the Game Project from the videos?
4. Can we modify final game project?
5. Can we use other libraries for final game project (ie. raylib)

Challenges:

1. W05 Challenge - Finding the largest product of a sequence of 5 digits in a 1000 digit number. 
I used string functions since I assumed the 1000 digit number is represented as a string or array of characters.

2. W05 Challenge V2 - The same challenge, this time using a recursive lambda function. Less code and less efficient, but I wanted to learn about lambda functions.
